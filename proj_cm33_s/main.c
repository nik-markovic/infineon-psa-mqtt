* This is the main function for Cortex M33 CPU secure application
* NOTE: CM33 secure project assumes that certain memory and peripheral regions
* will be accessed from non-secure environment by the CM33 NS /CM55 code,
* For such regions MPC and PPC configurations are applied by cybsp_init to make 
* it non-secure. Any access to these regions from the secure side is recommended 
* to be done before the MPC/PPC configuration is applied.Once a memory or 
* peripheral region is marked as non secure it cannot be accessed from the secure 
* side using secure aliased address but may be accessed using non secure aliased 
* address
